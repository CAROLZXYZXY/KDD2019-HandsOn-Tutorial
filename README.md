## Abstract

Many real-world datasets come in the form of graphs. These datasets include social networks, biological networks, knowledge graphs, the World Wide Web, and many more. Having a comprehensive understanding of these networks is essential to truly understand many important applications.

This hands-on tutorial introduces the fundamental concepts and tools used in modeling large-scale graphs and knowledge graphs. The audience will learn a spectrum of techniques used to build applications that use graphs and knowledge graphs: ranging from traditional data analysis and mining methods to the emerging deep learning and embedding approaches. 

Five lab sessions are included to give the audience hands-on experience to work through real-life examples on major topics covered in this tutorial. This includes: 

1. understanding basic graph properties; 
2. using graph representation learning to explore network similarity;  
3. utilizing NLP and text mining techniques to build knowledge graphs; 
4. modeling knowledge graphs with embedding techniques and how to apply it to recommendation applications.

We use **[Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/)** -- the largest publicly available academic domain knowledge graph â€“- as the dataset to demonstrate the algorithms and applications presented here. MAG includes 6 types of entities with 450 million nodes, and over 3 billion edges covering more than 660K academic concepts. The MAG dataset (500G+) is regularly updated at a bi-weekly cadence. We use a _Top CS Conference Sub-Graph_ from one of the most up-to-date data versions for this hands-on tutorial. _**The full graph with bi-weekly updates is available for free [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/get-started-setup-provisioning)**_.  

Key takeaways for attendees will be: 

- a solid understanding of graph and knowledge graph fundamentals and advanced representation learning techniques; 
- hands-on experience with state-of-the-art algorithms and analytics for a large-scale dataset; 
- explore the possibilities to create semantic search experience with their own private contents.
